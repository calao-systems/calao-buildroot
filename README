Note: The calao-buildroot has been tested with crosstool-NG-1.9.0
This toolchain has been built from the config file located in the below directory:
/lib/ct-ng-1.9.0/samples/arm-unknown-linux-uclibcgnueabi/crosstool.config
You will find more information at: http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/projects/crosstool
 
You should also be able to build the binaries from the Lite version of the
CodeSourcery Toolchain by adjusting several options.
